# codes
echo **hello**
it gives another output that we are not expecting
echo '**hello**'----->special characters we need to quotes


**`difference b/w single and double quotes**`
single quotes----> a=10 ---->echo 'value of a = $a'
it just prints as it is value of a = $a
double quotes----> a=10 ---->echo "value of a = $a"
it just prints as it is value of a = 10
